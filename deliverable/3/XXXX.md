# [Issue XXXX](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/XXXX) #

Issue Title

----------------------------------------------------

## Description

Describe what the end goal of the feature would be. An example use case of the newly implemented feature would be useful here. Describe the problem that this feature is trying to fix, perhaps an existing task that is inefficient to do. Describe the current way of doing things, and how this new feature would improve it.

## Affected Components & Location in Code

Describe each of the components that may be affected by the implementation of the feature. Describe how the existing interactions of the components are changed, and whether these changes are acceptable. Describe the benefits to be gained, and the disadvatages.

## Design Choices

#### Component 1 ####

Description of how Component 1 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

#### Component 2 ####

Description of how Component 2 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

## Time Estimate

## Reason of Choice to Implement

Describe why we chose to implement this issue instead of the other one. Good reasons would be that this issue would bring more benefits to matplotlib users, or is more requested, or that this issue is more feasible to implement within the given timeframe. Other possible good reasons: more of a challenge, changes to be introduced are easy to integrate into the existing matplotlib architecture/use-cases.

## Unit Tests

Describe any unit-test cases and where they will reside. Describe the purpose of each unit test, and the coverage of this test suite.

## Acceptance Tests

Describe step-by-step instructions on how the user will execute these tests. Describe the purpose of each acceptance test, and the coverage of this test suite.

## Time Estimate

Describe time estimate in developer hours based on analysis of design choices.
