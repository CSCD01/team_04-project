# [Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876) #

Errorbar: do not ignore inf but plot errorbar bigger than current frame size

----------------------------------------------------

## Description

Describe what the end goal of the feature would be. An example use case of the newly implemented feature would be useful here. Describe the problem that this feature is trying to fix, perhaps an existing task that is inefficient to do. Describe the current way of doing things, and how this new feature would improve it.

## Affected Components & Location in Code

### Errorbar ###

**Errorbar** is defined in [Axes.py](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L3086). It corresponds to the range of error, or the size of the errorbar `xerr, yerr` of a particular point `x, y` in a graph. Sometimes a particular point has no range of error, so `xerr, yerr` can be omitted. The parameters for `errorbar` are described below, based on matplotlib documentation.

```
def errorbar(self, x, y, yerr=None, xerr=None,
             fmt='', ecolor=None, elinewidth=None, capsize=None,
```

`x, y`: `scalar` or `array-like`: these are the data positions, corresponding to points on a graph. `x` can either be a scalar, or an array describing the x-coordinates of the data positions. `y` is similar. 

`xerr, yerr`: `scalar` or `array-like`, `shape(N,)` or `shape(2,N)`. This is an optional parameter, corresponding to the size of the error bar. The size of the errors can be customized for different use cases.
- **`scalar`**: all the data points have the same range of error. Symmetric +/- values for all data points in the graph.
- **`shape(N,)`**: each of the data points have their own range of error. Symmetric +/- values for each data point in the graph.
- **`shape(2,N)`**: each of the data-points can have a range of asymmetric errors. There are two rows; the first row describing the lower (-) errors, and the second row describing the upper (+) errors. 
- **`None`**: no errorbar.

Here is a code snippet of where xerr and yerr are being handled.

```
if xerr is not None:
    left, right = extract_err(xerr, x)
    # select points without upper/lower limits in x and
    # draw normal errorbars for these points
```
```
if yerr is not None:
    lower, upper = extract_err(yerr, y)
    # select points without upper/lower limits in y and
    # draw normal errorbars for these points
```

For the implementation of this feature, we would have to change the handling of `yerr` and `xerr`, to account for when the error is `inf`. This depends on the design decision (either an error bar exceeding the frame size, or a special symbol).

There are other styling parameters such as `fmt` (formatting the data points and data lines, `ecolor` (specifying the colour of the errorbar line), `elinewidth` (specifying the linewidth of the errorbar lines), which we will omit in this documentation.

The `errorbar` method returns an instance of `ErrorbarContainer`.

### ErrorbarContainer ###

[`ErrorbarContainer`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/container.py#L71) extends `Container` and is described as the container for the artists for errorbars. It contains the datalines, with the error ranges corresponding to some data points. Errorbar takes as parameters `lines`, and `xerr`/`yerr`.

- `lines`: a tuple of (`data_line`, `caplines`, `barlinecols`)
    - `data_line`: an instance of `Line2D` which describes a line corresponding to data points.
    - `caplines`: a tuple of `Line2D` which correspond to the cap lines (tip of error range) for each data point.
    - `barlinecols`: a list of `LineCollection` corresponding to the error ranges.
- `xerr`/`yerr`: a boolean which is `True` if the errorbar has `x`/`y` errors, and `False` otherwise.

## Design Choices

Describe possible design choices and which components they affect. Describe the risks of each design choice, such as any possible tradeoffs (loss of backwards compatibility, usability, intuitiveness, efficiency).

## Time Estimate

Describe time estimate in developer hours based on analysis of design choices.
