Errorbar: do not ignore inf but plot errorbar bigger than current frame size

----------------------------------------------------

## Description


This change request is about the behaviour of error bars when supplied with an “infinite” range of error. The change request asked that “infinite” errors would be displayed with an error range that exceeds the frame size. This would serve as an intuitive visual that there is an “infinite” error range. Currently, when a data point either has an error of `inf`, this would result in no error bar for that particular data point. The same behaviour is seen when a data point has an error of `nan`. This behaviour could be confusing for errors, because one can argue that `nan` and `inf` are not really the same value.

There has been some discussion about the meaning of an infinite error which should be viewed as undefined, however, the change request is about representing the infinite error bar in a more explicit way so that the user would not get confused with a `nan` error bar. Moreover, by displaying an error bar can indicate what is happening at a particular data point and the user can be warned if that is not the expected output, instead of confusing it with `nan`.

Showing an error bar, presumably bigger than the size of the axes, when the error is `inf` would be a better representation over a non-existent error. Another proposed solution is to either remove the data point, or to plot a different symbol representing the infinite range of error. The error value does not necessarily represent `inf` but instead a  most accurate representation of the error can be undefined.

For instance, in the following example both instances of error bars with error `inf` and `nan` are plotted the same way, which means that the user cannot distinguish the errorbars from each other. The implementation of this feature would hopefully improve the intuitiveness of errorbars.

```
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 9))
a = numpy.arange(10)
b = a**2
c = numpy.array([1.0] * 10)
c[2] = numpy.nan
c[8] = numpy.inf
ax1.errorbar(a,b,c)
plt.show()

```

### Errorbar ###

**Errorbar** is defined in [Axes.py](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L3086). It corresponds to the range of error, or the size of the errorbar `xerr, yerr` of a particular point `x, y` in a graph. Sometimes a particular point has no range of error, so `xerr, yerr` can be omitted. 

There are other styling parameters such as `fmt` (formatting the data points and data lines, `ecolor` (specifying the colour of the errorbar line), `elinewidth` (specifying the linewidth of the errorbar lines), which we will omit in this documentation.

The parameters for `errorbar` are described below, based on matplotlib documentation.

```
def errorbar(self, x, y, yerr=None, xerr=None,
             fmt='', ecolor=None, elinewidth=None, capsize=None,
             barsabove=False, lolims=False, uplims=False,
             xlolims=False, xuplims=False, errorevery=1, capthick=None,
             **kwargs):
```

`x, y`: `scalar` or `array-like`: these are the data positions, corresponding to points on a graph. `x` can either be a scalar, or an array describing the x-coordinates of the data positions. `y` is similar. 

`xerr, yerr`: `scalar` or `array-like`, `shape(N,)` or `shape(2,N)`. This is an optional parameter, corresponding to the size of the error bar. The size of the errors can be customized for different use cases.
- **`scalar`**: all the data points have the same range of error. Symmetric +/- values for all data points in the graph.
- **`shape(N,)`**: each of the data points have their own range of error. Symmetric +/- values for each data point in the graph.
- **`shape(2,N)`**: each of the data-points can have a range of asymmetric errors. There are two rows; the first row describing the lower (-) errors, and the second row describing the upper (+) errors. 
- **`None`**: no errorbar.

`lolims`, `uplims`, `xololims`, and `xuplims`: these indicate whether or not a value only honours upper/lower limits (y-axis), or x-upper/x-lower limits (x-axis). A special caret symbol indicates that only a certain limit dimension is honoured. 

Here is a code snippet of where xerr and yerr are being handled. The `extract_err` method is described afterwards.

```
if xerr is not None:
    left, right = extract_err(xerr, x)
    # select points without upper/lower limits in x and
    # draw normal errorbars for these points
```
```
if yerr is not None:
    lower, upper = extract_err(yerr, y)
    # select points without upper/lower limits in y and
    # draw normal errorbars for these points
```

For the implementation of this feature, we would have to change the handling of `yerr` and `xerr`, to account for when the error is `inf`. This depends on the design decision (either an error bar exceeding the frame size, or a special symbol).

The `errorbar` method also defines two private functions [`xywhere()`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L3319) and more importantly, [`extract_err()`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L3330). This function takes two iterables `err` (which defines the errors for each data point), and `data` (the data points). Then it adds/subtracts those errors onto the data points and returns the upper and lower limit errors for the data. 

```
def extract_err(err, data):
    ...
    low = [v - e for v, e in zip(data, a)]
    high = [v + e for v, e in zip(data, b)]
    return low, high
```

The `errorbar` method returns an instance of `ErrorbarContainer`.

### ErrorbarContainer ###

[`ErrorbarContainer`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/container.py#L71) extends `Container` and is described as the container for the artists for errorbars. It contains the datalines, with the error ranges corresponding to some data points. Errorbar takes as parameters `lines`, and `xerr`/`yerr`.

- `lines`: a tuple of (`data_line`, `caplines`, `barlinecols`)
    - `data_line`: an instance of `Line2D` which describes a line corresponding to data points.
    - `caplines`: a tuple of `Line2D` which correspond to the cap lines (tip of error range) for each data point.
    - `barlinecols`: a list of `LineCollection` corresponding to the error ranges.
- `xerr`/`yerr`: a boolean which is `True` if the errorbar has `x`/`y` errors, and `False` otherwise.

## Design Choices

Most or all of the code changes should be in the [`errorbar()`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py#L3086) method. As mentioned previously, there has been discussion on whether or not an infinite range of error even makes sense. Currently it is treated the same as a range of error: nan. The question would be how to distinguish these two values.

We would need to change how we handle the inputs `xerr`, and `yerr`, to account for the value of `inf`.

The first option is to display an errorbar extending the frame size, to symbolize an infinite error range.

The second option is to display a special marker on the data point, to symbolize the special value of `inf`.
