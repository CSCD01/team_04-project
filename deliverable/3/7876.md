----------------------------------------------------

## Description

Describe what the end goal of the feature would be. An example use case of the newly implemented feature would be useful here. Describe the problem that this feature is trying to fix, perhaps an existing task that is inefficient to do. Describe the current way of doing things, and how this new feature would improve it.

## Affected Components & Location in Code

Describe each of the components that may be affected by the implementation of the feature. Describe how the existing interactions of the components are changed, and whether these changes are acceptable. Describe the benefits to be gained, and the disadvatages.

#### Component 1 ####

Description of how Component 1 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

#### Component 2 ####

Description of how Component 2 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

## Design Choices

Describe possible design choices and which components they affect. Describe the risks of each design choice, such as any possible tradeoffs (loss of backwards compatibility, usability, intuitiveness, efficiency).

## Time Estimate

Describe time estimate in developer hours based on analysis of design choices.
