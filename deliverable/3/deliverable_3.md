## Feature Documentation

We have chosen the document the features described in **[Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876)** and **[Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460)**. 

### [Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460) ### 
We have documented, and designed this feature.

[**Documentation and Design**](./1460.md)

### [Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876) ### 
We have documented, designed, created acceptance tests, and implementation plans for this feature.

[**Documentation and Design**](./7876.md)

[**Implementation Plans and Justification**](./7876_impl.md)

[**Acceptance Testing**](./7876_tests.md)

## Architecture Revisited ##

We have revisited the architecture of matplotlib. Based on knowledge we've gained from previous deliverables (and this deliverable), we present a higher level architecture description.

[**High Level Architecture**](./architecture.md)

We also took a more granular look at the components affected both the features we have documented.

[**Architecture related to Issue 7876**](./architecture_7876.md)

[**Architecture related to Issue 1460**](./architecture_1460.md)
