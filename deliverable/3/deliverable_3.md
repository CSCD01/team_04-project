## Feature Documentation

We have chosen the document the features described in **[Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876)** and **[Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460)**. 

### [Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460) ### 
We have documented this feature [here](./1460.md).

### [Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876) ### 
We have documented this feature, the reason for choosing to implement it, and explained implementation plans [here](./XXXX.md).

## Architecture Revisited ##
We have revisited the architecture of matplotlib. Based on knowledge we've gained from previous deliverables (and this deliverable), we present an updated architecture description, with a more granular look at the components affected by the selected features [here](./architecture.md)
