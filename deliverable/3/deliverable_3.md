Handout: https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~atafliovich/cscd01/project/deliverable3.pdf

## Feature Documentation

We have chosen the document the features described in **[Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876)** and **[Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460)**. 

### [Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460) ### 
We have documented this feature [here](./1460.md).

### [Issue 7876](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7876) ### 
We have documented this feature [here](./7876.md).

We explained the reason for choosing to implement it, and implementation plans [here](./7876_impl.md).

## Architecture Revisited ##

We have revisited the architecture of matplotlib. Based on knowledge we've gained from previous deliverables (and this deliverable), we present a higher level architecture description [here]().

We also took a more granular look at the components affected both the features we have documented.

[**Architecture related to Issue 7876**](./architecture_7876).

[**Architecture related to Issue 1460**](./architecture_1460).
