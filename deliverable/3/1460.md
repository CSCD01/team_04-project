Make Subplots Smarter With Regards To `subplot_kw` and `figure_kw`.

----------------------------------------------------

## Description

This feature would allow for "smarter" parsing of keywords passed to [`pyplot.subplots()`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py#L1034). Currently, dictionaries `subplot_kw` and `gridspec_kw` are used to differentiate keywords that are used for the instantiation of subplots and grid specifications. However, it was noted that using these dictionaries makes the code for calling the `pyplot.subplots()` method more complicated than it needs to be. 

Here is an example that demonstrates under the current implementation how [`pyplot.subplots()`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py#L1034) is supposed to be called: 
``` 
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, subplot_kw=dict(polar=True))
```
However, a more elegant way of calling would be something similar to the following: 
``` 
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, polar=True) 
```

This would only be possible if there were no ambiguities between keywords defined in `subplot_kw`, `gridspec_kw`, and `fig_kw`. If there were such ambiguities, then there is definitely a need for a separation of the keywords into their respective destinations. We attempted to implement this feature for Deliverable 2, by creating a list of possible arguments (unfortunately hard-coded) that could be passed as subplot keyword arguments. 

However, after a discussion with the maintainers in the [pull request](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16738) we submitted, two main points came up.
1. Since the arguments are cascadingly passed to other functions, hard-coding a list of arguments that are passed is both insufficient and inextendable. It serves as a temporary patch. Every time a new subplot keyword is introduced, it would need to be added to that list of arguments.
2. The changes made to accomodate passing the arguments without a dictionary should be extendable to `gridspec_kw`, which operates in the same way as `subplot_kw`.

Therefore for the completion of this feature, we need to allow "smart" parsing of `subplot_kw` and `gridspec_kw` keywords (without the use of dictionaries). We need `pyplot.subplots()` to handle the redirecting of these keywords to the methods to which they are offloaded. In a sense, the work of separating these arguments are lifted from the user. We would also need to do so without hard-coding the list of possible arguments that can be passed. 

## Affected Components & Location in Code

Describe each of the components that may be affected by the implementation of the feature. Describe how the existing interactions of the components are changed, and whether these changes are acceptable. Describe the benefits to be gained, and the disadvatages.

### Pyplot ###

As previously mentioned in Deliverable 1, `Pyplot` alone is considered as the scripting layer (one of the three layers in matplotlib). It provides wrappers for backend layer methods, as well as artist layer methods. For this documentation, we will be focusing on artist layer wrappers, namely `Pyplot.subplots()`.

`Pyplot.subplots()` is an artist layer wrapper. It is a shorthand method for creating common layouts of subplots, and the enclosing `Figure`, in a single call. It combines the work of creating multiple subplots, and the `Figure` containing them, which would normally be done with two calls.

```
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 20))
ax = plt.subplot(111, axisbg='w')
```

Using `Pyplot.subplots()`, the above two lines are condensed to:

```
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 20), subplot_kw=dict(axisbg='w'))
```

To do so, `Pyplot.subplots()` accepts parameters needed to instantiate a new `Figure`, and also to generate a new `Axes` containing the subplots. Below is the definition of `Pyplot.subplots()`, with the docstring omitted.

```
def subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, sharex=False, sharey=False, squeeze=True,
             subplot_kw=None, gridspec_kw=None, **fig_kw):
    fig = figure(**fig_kw)
    axs = fig.subplots(nrows=nrows, ncols=ncols, sharex=sharex, sharey=sharey,
                       squeeze=squeeze, subplot_kw=subplot_kw,
                       gridspec_kw=gridspec_kw)
    return fig, axs
```

The arguments used to instantiate a `Figure` is handled via keyword arguments in `**fig_kw`. This `Figure` is then used as a container for the subplots created. The rest of the arguments are delegated to the `Figure.subplots`.

### Figure ###

As mentioned in Deliverable 1, `Figure` is a top-level container for `Artist` objects. It serves as a container for `Axes` (which is a container itself). `Figure` has multiple methods to help handling the `Artist` instances that it contains.

`Figure.subplots()` takes parameters `ncol`, `nrows`, `subplot_kw`, and `gridspec_kw`, among others.

- **`ncol`**: the number of columns for the subplots.
- **`nrows`**: the number of rows for the subplots.
- **`subplots_kw`**: to-do
- **`gridspec_kw`**: to-do

We can see that `subplot_kw` is passed onto [`Figure.add_subplot`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/figure.py) below in [line 1566](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/figure.py#L1566). This is because the keywords are used to style each individual subplot being added. This means that we can't easily omit the `subplot_kw` argument from `Pyplot`.

```
axarr[row, col] = self.add_subplot(gs[row, col], **subplot_kw)
```

## Time Estimate

Describe time estimate in developer hours based on analysis of design choices.

## Reason of Choice to Implement

Describe why we chose to implement this issue instead of the other one. Good reasons would be that this issue would bring more benefits to matplotlib users, or is more requested, or that this issue is more feasible to implement within the given timeframe. Other possible good reasons: more of a challenge, changes to be introduced are easy to integrate into the existing matplotlib architecture/use-cases.

## Unit Tests

Describe any unit-test cases and where they will reside. Describe the purpose of each unit test, and the coverage of this test suite.

## Acceptance Tests
