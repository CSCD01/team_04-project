# [Issue 1460](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1460) #

Make Subplots Smarter With Regards To `subplot_kw` and `figure_kw`.

----------------------------------------------------

## Description

Describe what the end goal of the feature would be. An example use case of the newly implemented feature would be useful here. Describe the problem that this feature is trying to fix, perhaps an existing task that is inefficient to do. Describe the current way of doing things, and how this new feature would improve it.

This issue is about the unnecessary use of dictionaries to pass `subplot_kw` argument when calling [`pyplot.subplots()`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py#L1034).
Here is an example that demonstrates under the current implementation how [`pyplot.subplots()`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py#L1034) is supposed to be called: 
``` 
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, subplot_kw=dict(polar=True))
```
However, a more elegant way of calling would be something similar to the following: 
``` 
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, polar=True) 
```
For D2, we fixed this issue by hard-coding a list of possible arguments that could be passed as subplot keyword arguments. However, after a discussion with the maintainers in the [pull request](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/16738) we submitted, two main points came up.
1. Since the arguemnts are cascadingly passed to other functions, hardcoding a list of arguments that are passed is both insufficient and inextendable. 
2. The changes made to accomodate passing the arguments without a dictionary should be extendable to `gridspec_kw`.

Therefore for the completion of this feature, we need to allow passing arguments of `subplot_kw` and `gridspec_kw` without the use of dictionaries and without hardcoding the list of possible arguments that can be passed. 

## Affected Components & Location in Code

Describe each of the components that may be affected by the implementation of the feature. Describe how the existing interactions of the components are changed, and whether these changes are acceptable. Describe the benefits to be gained, and the disadvatages.

## Design Choices

#### Component 1 ####

Description of how Component 1 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

#### Component 2 ####

Description of how Component 2 would be affected by this new feature.

#### Location in Code ####

```
print("Hello World)
```

## Time Estimate

Describe time estimate in developer hours based on analysis of design choices.

## Reason of Choice to Implement

Describe why we chose to implement this issue instead of the other one. Good reasons would be that this issue would bring more benefits to matplotlib users, or is more requested, or that this issue is more feasible to implement within the given timeframe. Other possible good reasons: more of a challenge, changes to be introduced are easy to integrate into the existing matplotlib architecture/use-cases.

## Unit Tests

Describe any unit-test cases and where they will reside. Describe the purpose of each unit test, and the coverage of this test suite.

## Acceptance Tests

Describe step-by-step instructions on how the user will execute these tests. Describe the purpose of each acceptance test, and the coverage of this test suite.
