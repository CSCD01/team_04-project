# Artist Layer

`Artist`: this is the base class of all artists. It resides [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/artist.py) The `Artist` object uses the renderer to draw on the FigureCanvas. The `Artist` will relate its coordinate system with the canvasâ€™ and indicate where the object can be drawn. It converts the abstract representation of the object to an actual drawing for the user.

There are both primitive and composite sub-classes of `Artist` objects. The composite subclasses derive from `Container`, whose base class resides [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/container.py):

## Primitives

Primitives can stand on their own in figures, or they can also be part of composites.

- `Line2D`
- Shape classes such as `Rectangle`, `Polygon`, `Circle`, `Ellipse`.
- Texts such as `ArcText`, `Annotation`, and `TextPath`. Images such as `AxesImage` and `FigureImage`

## Composites

Composites can contain other composite objects, or primitive objects.

- `Axis` (`XAxis`, and `Yaxis`). `Tick`, `Axes`, `PolarAxes`, `HammerAxes`, etc.
- Collections: [these](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/collections.py) are classes that allow for efficient rendering of large numbers of similar objects (e.g. thousands of Rectangles). Some classes: PathCollection, CircleCollection.
