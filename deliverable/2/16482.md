# [Issue 16482](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/16482)

Pyplot hlines and vlines do not use the 'lines.color' property in rcParams by default

----------------------------------------------------

This is a: **Change Request**.

## Description
This issue is about wanting to be set the `colors` parameter in both `hlines` and `vlines` method in pyplot (as well as in `axes`). Instead of using `k` as the default parameter for colour, it should at least try `lines.color` which it should extract from `rcParams`.
