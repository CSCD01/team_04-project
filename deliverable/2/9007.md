# [Issue 9007](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/9007)

`set_facecolor` method does not auto-update in `ipython`.

----------------------------------------------------

This is a: **Bug**.

## Description

Each `Artist` has a `_stale` field, which indicates that the `Artist` has changed since it was last drawn to the backend. This field is not being properly set by the `ax` axis.

## Location in code

In `axes/_base.py`, one line which `_AxesBase` attempts to update the `_stale` field is incorrect. On [line 541 of `axes/_base.py`](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/master/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py#L541), the attempt to update the stale field is done directly on the `_stale` field instead of the setter: the `stale(self, val)` class method inherited from `Artist`. The setter calls the callbacks which update parents. If these callbacks are not called, then parent Artists are not updated when children are modified.

## Time Estimate

0.5 hours to write a small Pytest that checks that the flag is not being propagated up to parents of `_AxesBase` derivatives and make the 1-line change necessary to make it pass.

## Proposed Fix Outline

Use the `stale(self, value)` setter method inherited from Artist, instead of directly setting the `_stale` field.

That is, we would replace the line that looks like 

```python
self._stale = True
```

with lines like:
```python
self.stale = True
```

Which calls the setter method, due to the `@stale.setter` decorator.
