# [Issue 14233](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/14233)

Allow setting default AutoMinorLocator

----------------------------------------------------

This is a: **New Feature**.

## Description

In the `rcParams`, you can set a minor tick rate (grid lines) to be displayed for all of your plots. Missing from this is the ability to set a default rate for these ticks. The request is for a feature where you would be able to set this default value. 

## Location in code

Currently, the class [`AutoMinorLocator`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/3205ff797038fb4662b843faceeaaec1f63acef9/lib/matplotlib/ticker.py#L2749) (which is responsible for dynamically finding the minor tick locations) does have a default, but you have no control over what it is (defaults to 4 or 5).

The main section to change would be in the classes [`__call__`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/3205ff797038fb4662b843faceeaaec1f63acef9/lib/matplotlib/ticker.py#L2764) method. Here, we would need to check for the default value in `rcParams`, before falling back to the current 4 or 5 logic. 

## Time Estimate
1-2 hours

## Proposed Fix Outline
Find or add an object to the [`rcParams`](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/3205ff797038fb4662b843faceeaaec1f63acef9/lib/matplotlib/rcsetup.py#L1040) dict that stores a minor tick rate when minor ticks are turned on. Then update `AutoMinorLocator` to check and use this value before defaulting to 4 or 5. We would get the `rcParams` value with call similar to `mpl.rcParams['ticks.minor.count']`. 

`'ticks.minor.count'` is not currently a default dictionary value in [rcsetup.py#L1323](https://github.com/CSCD01-team04/matplotlib/blob/3205ff797038fb4662b843faceeaaec1f63acef9/lib/matplotlib/rcsetup.py#L1323), so we would either need to add it here, or use one of the values that is already there. Alternatively, we could add it to the `rcParams` dict when you enable minor ticks.
